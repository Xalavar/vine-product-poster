# Vine 1-CAP (1-Click Auto Poster)
A tool to help make sharing items on Vine to Discord with the click of a button! It is designed to work with Thorvarium's API so users can post new products to the Discord server.

Note: Embed and product images are not generated by this script.

# What it does:

This script compiles the product information loaded onto the page and sends it over an API call to the Vine member exclusive Discord server. The goal of this is to make it quicker and easier for people to share items from any queue without needing to copy/paste or type anything into the server.

Here's a list of information it pulls from the page:

* Parent ASIN
* ETV (Estimated Taxable Value)
* Seller name
* Dropdown names
* Dropdown options
* Limited quantity

# Compatibility

1-CAP is configured to work in the US, UK, and Canada. However, it can be used for other countries with some tweaking. Let me know if it's not working for your country, and I'll see if I can help.

# FAQ

**Q**: Can I use this for a different Discord server?

**A**: Yes, but you'll likely need to make some modifications and possibly add your own code. If this is something you want to do, I would suggest forking this repository so you can keep your version up to date. You'd also need an API and a server to help manage the data that gets sent to your Discord server.

**Q**: Could I get kicked out of Vine for using this?

**A**: No. This is 100% safe to use and won't trip up Amazon's bot detection because it's only reading information on the page and not interacting with Amazon's servers in any way. 

**Q**: How do I get invited to Vi—

**A**: No.
