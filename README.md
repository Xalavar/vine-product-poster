# Vine 1-CAP (1-Click Auto Poster)
A tool to help make sharing items on Vine to Discord with the click of a button! It is designed to work with Thorvarium's API so users can post new products to the Discord server.

* ETV

# FAQ

**Q**: Can I use this for a different Discord server?

**A**: Technically, yes, you can, but you'll likely need to make some light to heavy modifications and possibly add your own code. If this is something you want to do, I would suggest forking this repository so we can better collaborate.

**Q**: Could I get kicked out of Vine for using this?

**A**: No, this is 100% safe to use. It doesn't pull any information from Amazon's servers, so it won't trip up the bot detection on their website.

**Q**: How do I get invited to Vi—

**A**: No.
